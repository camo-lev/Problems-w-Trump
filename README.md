# Problems with Trump
All of the stupid things Trump has done, broken down and sourced.
**Sources are hyperlinked in the titles.**

## Trump instituted the most gun control of any President since Bill Clinton:
### [FIX NICS Act in 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2135)
- Signed the Fix NICS Act in 2018, which strengthened the National Instant Criminal Background Check System by requiring federal agencies and states to improve their reporting of criminal records and other information to the system.

### [Bump Stock Ban 2018-2019](https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/bump-stocks)

## Trump consistently disparaging veterans
### [Trump disparaged PoWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI_Y8l3U8mo): Live event @ 5:10
  - Trump calls John McCain (veteran & former PoW) a "loser", claiming he wasn't a war hero because he was captured, and that he "likes people who weren't captured".
### [Trump campaign "unfairly attacked" an Arlington (Veteran) Cemetary employee](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/06/trump-arlington-national-cemetery/)
  - The Trump campaign was filming and photographing in an area where only official Arlington photographers are allowed to do so.
  - When a cemetery official tried to enforce these rules, Trump's staff allegedly "verbally abused and pushed the official aside"
  - Arlington National Cemetery officials stated that all participants, including Trump's campaign, were informed of federal laws, Army regulations, and DoD policies prohibiting political activities on cemetery grounds
### [Numerous reports of Trump making extremely disrespectful comments towards veterans](https://www.federaltimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/10/03/trump-insulted-vets-in-private-former-chief-of-staff-kelly-confirms/)
  - These claims are made by John Kelly, a former 4 star Marine Corps general
  - John Kelly was also Trump's own Chief of Staff during Trump's presidency.

## [Trump overall had worse economic performance than Biden](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/biden-versus-trump-economy/)
  - Trump increased the deficit more than Biden, even when you factor out COVID spending (from both Biden and Trump) [8.4tr for Trump - 4.3tr for Biden) 
  - Trump's stock market did worse than Biden's (again, even when factoring out COVID) [33.6% for Trump - 42.1% for Biden]
  - Trump's job market did worse than Biden's (again, even when factoring out COVID) [12.6m for Trump - 15.6m for Biden]

*Large economies like the USA's are often too complicated for Presidents to control directly, but many peoplem are making claims about Trump's economic performance, which are often not true.*

## Trump attempted to falsify voting (electoral college) slates in his favor during the 2020 election
*The fake electors scheme was a coordinated effort by Trump allies to submit fraudulent slates of electors from seven states that Trump lost in the 2020 election, with the aim of overturning the legitimate election results and keeping Trump in power. The plan involved recruiting Republican officials to pose as legitimate electors, creating false certificates of ascertainment, and attempting to have these fake electoral votes counted instead of the actual votes during the January 6th certification process.
Trump, Kenneth Cheesebro, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, and various (84) other Republicans planned and implemented this scheme.*

**This would have resulted in 7 states swapping their electoral college vote from Biden to Trump**
### [Trump's team conspired to send in "fake" electors, and even called them that in their communications](https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf) 
  - "We would just be sending in 'fake' electoral votes to Pence so that 'someone' in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the 'fake' votes should be counted." Page 24/45, although the entire doc is damning.
### Trump amplified debunked claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which lead to the riots on 01/06
  - These claims had been debunked in court: 62 lawsuits in total; 61/62 of the lawsuits were dismisssed, only one (very minor) victory. The lawsuits were thrown out for various reasons, such as lack of legal standing, procedural errors in the filings, allegations without merit, and largely a lack of evidence.
  - [Giuliani admitted to making false statements about the Georgia election workers](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.238720/gov.uscourts.dcd.238720.84.2.pdf), but he [argued that his statements were protected by the First Amendment](https://casetext.com/case/freeman-v-giuliani).
### [Trump waited 3 hours to call off the 01/06 riots during the certification of the election](https://www.americanoversight.org/timeline-jan6)
  - Despite claims online, rioters DID break into the capital using force.
  - Police did NOT lead the rioters in, instead they diverted them away from various officials (including Pence) because they were overwhelmed and outnumbers. This occurred after they had already broken in.
  - Another breakdown video can be found here: https://youtu.be/0vzeTgm2qWw
### During the 01/06 riots, Trump used the riots to pressure Pence into falling in line with his plan; Pence rejected this pressure.
  - Had Mike Pence agreed, the election would not have been certified on 01/06 as it was (although it was delayed due to the riots, also instigated by Trump).
  - Pence and other officials were pressured via various means, including direct phone calls from Trump and [tweets attacking them on 01/06](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/tweets-january-6-2021). 
### [Many of the fake electors are now being prosecuted in their state courts. (some fake electors from states like PA & NM hedged their language, likely saving them from prosecution)](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-cases-against-fake-electors-and-where-they-stand/)
  - [Arizona](https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-names-additional-defendants-fake-elector-case)
    - Includes: Rudy Guiliani, Mark Meadows, John Eastment, and other Republican fake electors..
  - [Georgia](https://www.fultonclerk.org/DocumentCenter/View/2092/MOTION-08-16-2023-151715-39070073-1C86D04A-9755-4D11-B5B2-0C36FAC21C70)
    - Includes: Donald Trump, John Eastman, Rudy Guiliani, Mart Meadows, and other Republicans..
    - This is the case regarding notorious [phone call](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/02/15/read-full-transcript-donald-trumps-call-brad-raffensperger/) where Trump asks Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, to ["find 11,780 votes"](https://youtu.be/CeYDPjT5zTg), which would be only ONE more vote than Biden had, reversing the state.
    - Some critics say this was Trump attempting to find evidence to present to authorities such as the FBI to justify further investigation, although this is unlikely given the number he cited. And because Brad (a Republican himself) himself disagreed with Trump due to their own recounts and audits in the state. (More info and sources on state recounts/audits below)
  - [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/ag/-/media/Project/Websites/AG/releases/2023/July/Felony-Complaints-Redacted-combined.pdf)
    - Includes: Various Republican Michiganders who were engaged party activists.
    - [More info...](https://statesunited.org/resources/michigan-fake-electors/)
  - [Nevada](https://ag.nv.gov/News/PR/2023/Attorney_General_Ford_Announces_the_Indictment_of_Six_Nevadans_Who_Falsely_Represented_Themselves_as_State_Electors_in_2020/)
    - Includes: Various (6) Nevada Republicans who were engaged party activists.
    - On June 21, 2024 a Clark County District Court dismissed the charges for lack of jurisdiction. The Attorney General promised to appeal.
  - [Wisconsin](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/icap/our-work/promoting-good-government-voting-rights-whistleblowers-and-transparency/penebaker-v-hitt/)
    - Includes: James Troupis, legal adviser Kenneth Chesebro, and the 10 Trump-Pence electors in Wisconsin.
    - This case is already closed, as the defendents settled, which included the following:
      - Acknowledgements that their actions were part of an effort to overturn the 2020 election results.
      - Agreement to not serve as electors in the election or sign false certifications in future elections.
  - Pennsylvania: TODO
  - New Mexico: TODO

### There were no recounts or audits to help reassure 2020 Presidential election results
  TODO, make a table for each swing state with columns for number of audits and recounts
